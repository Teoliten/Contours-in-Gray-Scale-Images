Implement a program that opens image files. If the images are color images, your program must transform them into gray-scale images. Your program must attemt to find the contours of all objects in the image. Store the contour information of objects in vector format in a file: use Freeman codes. Your program must have a GUI that visualizes both images and discovered contours.
